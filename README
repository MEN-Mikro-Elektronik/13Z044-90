When ever  you are going to change some parts on an existing configuration or
source tree (which is not already version controlled) it is very helpful to do
    git init; git add ,; git -ci -m 'still unchanged tree'
And then commit your changes frequently with REALLY EXPLANATORY commit
messages. This will help you to remember later (maybe a half year or more).
Also everybody else will love you forever, because he can better understand
what you did, when he has to continue your work.
AND YES, YOU HAVE THE TIME!!! You saved it already in that other project,
where one of your colleagues already documented his work in an understandable
way. Remember: WE are a team. Let a git help you.

How to build this driver
------------------------

1) in MDIS source tree
Let's assume that:
- you already have cloned this repo in REPODIR (e.g. /home/code/13z044-90/)
- MDIS is installed in MDISDIR (e.g. /opt/menlinux/)

Now do that (after you have put MDISDIR under git control):
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/DRIVERS/FB_16Z044/DRIVER/fb_men_16z044.c ${MDISDIR}/DRIVERS/FB_16Z044/DRIVER/fb_men_16z044.c
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/INCLUDE/NATIVE/MEN/fb_men_16z044.h ${MDISDIR}/INCLUDE/NATIVE/MEN/fb_men_16z044.h
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/PACKAGE_DESC/13z04490.xml ${MDISDIR}/PACKAGE_DESC/13z04490.xml
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/13Z044-90_history.txt ${MDISDIR}/13Z044-90_history.txt
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/13Z044-90_tree.txt ${MDISDIR}/13Z044-90_tree.txt
For the test tools:
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/TOOLS/FB_TEST/fb16z044_test.c ${MDISDIR}/TOOLS/FB_TEST/fb16z044_test.c
    ln -vsf ${REPODIR}/TOOLS/FB_TEST/program.mak ${MDISDIR}/TOOLS/FB_TEST/program.mak

Let's further assume MDIS is already configured, then just assure that
the MIDS main Makefile variable 'ALL_NATIVE_DRIVERS' contains
'DRIVERS/FB_16Z044/DRIVER/driver.mak'

Now build MDIS as usual.

2) as kernel off tree module
   - to be done -


How to build the tools
----------------------
Read the sections above and assure you have the links in 'TOOLS/'
Then add this to your main MDIS Makefile:
ALL_NATIVE_TOOLS = TOOLS/FB_TEST/program.mak

Now build MDIS as usual.
